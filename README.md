# Welcome to the Hydro Community Development Program!

The HCDP is a **core program** to Project Hydro. It is a collection of paid developer bounties **run by the Hydro Community** to advance the ecosystem or its products. Any community member can post and create a task for others to fulfill. These tasks could be for an SDK or library, dApps (Solidity), tutorials, enhancements and more. Tasks get assigned a bounty total and are paid upon fulfilling the requirements.


# List of Completed Hydro Tasks:

The following is a list of tasks **successfully completed** as part of the HCDP by our growing developer community to advance the Hydro ecosystem. Developers can utilize these plugins, smart contracts and code in their development to jump start their project or leverage advanced functionality without re-inventing the wheel.


## Hydro Smart Contracts:

* **[Random Lottery Dynamics](https://github.com/merlox/hydro-lottery):** An Ethereum smart contract uses Hydro Snowflake Ids (EINs) for creating unique lotteries with rewards setup in HYDRO tokens instead of ETH. It's made of an HydroEscrow contract that holds HYDRO for each unique lottery, a Randomizer contract that generates random numbers with Oracles for creating unique, secure randomized numbers for selecting winners and a HydroLottery contract that takes care of the main logic.

  * **Task Reference:** [Issue #256](https://github.com/HydroBlockchain/hcdp/issues/256).
  *  **Developer Bounty:** 4,000,000 Hydro
  * **Author:** [@merlox](https://github.com/merlox)
  * **Deliverable:** [Solidity Smart Contract](https://github.com/merlox/hydro-lottery)
  
* **[Hydro Glacier](https://github.com/ricktobacco/hydro-glacier):** An Ethereum smart contract on top of Hydro Snowflake that allows a certain percentage of interest on a defined principal amount, in HYDRO, to accrue and be charged (or paid) to a wallet tied to a SnowflakeID, and then for that balance to automatically be withdrawn (or paid). The smart contract will guarantee that the money is in the account by enforcing an escrow of the accruing payment within the wallet, thus eliminating payment default, or fraud from institutions. This utility smart contract will power charging interest in many future savings, lending, credit, and mortgage Hydro dApps. There will be Layer-3 dApps and Layer-4 APIs that hook into this utility smart contract function.

* **[Hydro Gift Cards](https://github.com/kdmukai/hydro-gift-card):** An Ethereum smart contract on top of Hydro Snowflake that allows a certain percentage of interest on a defined principal amount, in HYDRO, to accrue and be charged (or paid) to a wallet tied to a SnowflakeID, and then for that balance to automatically be withdrawn (or paid).
